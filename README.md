This project takes advantage of the well described multicomponent model of the Milky Way based in the Besan√ßon Galaxy model
to extend it to two dimesional luminosity profiles to extragalactic galaxies using a modified version of [GALFIT](https://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/galfit.html).
